# Setting up a server using Node and Express Instructions

1. Create app folder and `run npm init` in terminal after you cd into the directory

2. Make sure npm and node.js are both installed

3. Create a Server using a package from our local server (express.js)

- we can create a web network using express, it's lightweight
- downside is that you have to do extra legwork to make sure you have web security against hackers

run `npm install --save express`

This will give us our node_modules/packages/dependencies
node depends on these folders to run express
